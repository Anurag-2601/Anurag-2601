# Hi, I’m Anurag — ML & AI Engineer in Training

Focused on Computer Vision, Cyber-Attack Detection, and ML Model Deployment

I build practical, end-to-end systems — from preprocessing pipelines to model training, UI integration, and deployment-ready architecture. My work spans suspicious activity detection, IoT cyber-threat analysis, and data-driven dashboards.

## What I’m Currently Working On

**Cyber Threat Detection for IoT-Enabled CPS:**

Using AutoEncoders, PCA + Decision Trees, DNN, and a Tkinter-based desktop app for real-time analysis.

**Suspicious Activity Detection (YOLOv8 + HAR):** 

Integrating object detection + pose estimation + behavior rules.

**Machine Learning Pipelines:**

Cleaning datasets, building classifiers, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating with metrics.

## What I Do Differently

- Treat every project like a mini product, not a college assignment

- Write clear READMEs and create reproducible pipelines

- Focus on interpretability (SHAP, feature importance, metrics)

- Prioritize clean coding, not just working code

- Show the “why”, not just the “output”

## What I’m Looking For

An internship where I can apply my ML/AI skills in:

- Computer Vision

- Cybersecurity Analytics

- ML Engineering

- Applied Machine Learning

- Intelligent Automation

I’m ready to contribute to real-world systems, experiment, and solve practical problems.
